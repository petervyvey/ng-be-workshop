# Add AssemblyScript

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/stackblitz/ng-be-workshop/tree/main/exercises/webassembly/1-add-assemblyscript?file=src%2Fadd.ts)


## Exercise

Implement a function that takes two numbers and returns the sum of those numbers by using [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/).

You can compile the `add.ts` file by running

```
$ npm run build
```

> **Note**: The WASM binary file is invisible in StackBlitz as it's compiled to a `.dist` directory and thus hidden
for the user. The reason is that in order to use binary files on StackBlitz, you need a pro account.
